RESOURCE_DESCRIPTION = """Read the contents of a specific performance report for a specific Amazon RDS instance.

<use_case>
Use this resource to retrieve detailed performance analysis data from a specific Performance Insights report.
These reports contain comprehensive information about database performance issues, including root cause analysis,
top SQL queries causing load, wait events, and recommended actions for performance optimization.
</use_case>

<important_notes>
1. You must provide both a valid DB instance identifier and report identifier
2. The report must be in a SUCCEEDED status to be fully readable
3. Reports in RUNNING status may return partial results
4. Reports in FAILED status will return error information about why the analysis failed
5. Large reports may contain extensive data about the performance issues analyzed
</important_notes>

## Response structure
Returns a detailed performance report object containing:
- `AnalysisReportId`: Unique identifier for the performance report (string)
- `ServiceType`: Service type (always 'RDS' for RDS instances) (string)
- `CreateTime`: Time when the report was created (datetime)
- `StartTime`: Start time of the analysis period (datetime)
- `EndTime`: End time of the analysis period (datetime)
- `Status`: Current status of the report (RUNNING, SUCCEEDED, or FAILED) (string)
- `AnalysisData`: The detailed performance analysis (object)
  - May include metrics, anomalies, query analysis, and recommendations
- `Tags`: List of tags attached to the report (array of key-value pairs)

<examples>
Example usage scenarios:
1. Performance troubleshooting:
   - Analyze root causes of performance bottlenecks during a specific period
   - Identify top resource-consuming SQL queries during performance degradation
   - Review wait events that contributed to slowdowns

2. Performance optimization:
   - Review recommended actions to improve database performance
   - Analyze patterns in resource usage to guide optimization efforts
   - Document performance issues for change management or postmortem analysis
