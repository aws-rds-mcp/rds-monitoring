RESOURCE_DESCRIPTION = """List all available performance reports for a specific Amazon RDS instance.

<use_case>
Use this resource to discover all available Performance Insights analysis reports for a specific RDS database instance.
Performance reports provide detailed analysis of database performance issues, helping you identify bottlenecks and optimization opportunities.
</use_case>

<important_notes>
1. The response provides information about performance analysis reports generated for the instance
2. You must provide a valid DB resource identifier to retrieve reports
3. Performance reports are only available for instances with Performance Insights enabled
4. Reports are provided in chronological order with the most recent reports first
5. Use the `aws-rds://db-instance/{dbi_resource_identifier}/performance_report/{report_identifier}` resource to get detailed information about a specific report
</important_notes>

## Response structure
Returns an array of performance report objects, each containing:
- `analysis_report_id`: Unique identifier for the performance report (string)
- `create_time`: Time when the report was created (datetime)
- `start_time`: Start time of the analysis period (datetime)
- `end_time`: End time of the analysis period (datetime)
- `status`: Current status of the report (RUNNING, SUCCEEDED, or FAILED) (string)
- `tags`: List of tags attached to the report (array of key-value pairs)

<examples>
Example usage scenarios:
1. Performance monitoring:
   - List all available performance reports to identify periods of potential performance issues
   - Track reports generated during specific time periods of interest

2. Preparation for optimization:
   - Find specific report identifiers for detailed performance analysis
   - Monitor the status of recently generated performance reports
   - Identify long-running or failed reports that may need investigation
